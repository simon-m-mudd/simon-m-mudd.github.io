  <p class="post-excerpt">I am a <a href="http://www.rif.org/">Reader</a> at the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/home">University of Edinburgh</a>,

  <h2 class="post-title">Vitae</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">I am from Riverside, California. I then went to Berkeley, Santa Barbara, Tallahasse, and Nashville (<a href="http://nashville.about.com/od/historyandsites/a/NashHistXline2.htm">The Athens of the South</a>) for some degrees. NOAA kindly provided funding for me to stay in Nashville for a year after my PhD. Then I moved to Edinburgh (<a href="http://www.ewht.org.uk/learning/Athens/why-athens-of-the-north">The Athens of the North</a>) in 2007. I can now understand Glaswegans (including <a=href="http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/s0675405/">Stuart Grieve</a>) and my children rhyme 'food' with 'good'.

  <h2 class="post-title">Another tile</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Three tiles next to each other look much better than two tiles, so I will need to think of something to write here. Perhaps I will write something about <a href="http://www.hibernianfc.co.uk/">Hibernian FC</a> in this tile.</p>
