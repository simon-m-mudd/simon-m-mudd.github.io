<div class="tile">
  <h2 class="post-title">University of Edinburgh</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">I am a Reader at the University of Edinburgh (The Athens of the North), in the School of GeoSciences. One day I will provide html links to those places.</p>

<div class="tile">
  <h2 class="post-title">Vitae</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">I am from Riverside, California. I then went to Berkeley, Santa Barbara, Tallahasse, and Nashville (The Athens of the South) for some degrees. NOAA kindly provided funding for me to stay in Nashville for a year after my PhD. Then I moved to Edinburgh in 2007. I can now understand Glaswegans (including Stuart Grieve) and my children rhyme 'food' with 'good'. At some point I will link a latex-erific CV here.</p>

<div class="tile">
  <h2 class="post-title">Another tile</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Three tiles next to each other look much better than two tiles, so I will need to think of something to write here. Perhaps I will write something about Hibernian FC in this tile.</p>
