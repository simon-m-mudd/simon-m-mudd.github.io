## Research

  Many hazards have a geomrphic impact: floods, hurricanes, landslides and debris flows all change the surface of our planet. Because they alter topography, it may be possible to infer hazards from geomorphic indicators. Some of our group's work is relevant to hazard detection using geomorphic tools.
