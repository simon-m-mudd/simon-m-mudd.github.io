## Research

  In this paper we looked at the pattern of hillslope-channel coupling along the Mendocino Triple Junction, where we know that an uplift field is migrating north. We find a lag between hillslope properties and channel properties, and use this to trace the migration of the uplift field. Although scientists have known about this migration for some time, this is the first study that shows it can be traced using topographic data alone.
