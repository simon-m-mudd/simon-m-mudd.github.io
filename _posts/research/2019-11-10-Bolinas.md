## Research

  In this study, we wanted to explore hillslope-channel coupling in a landscape where we through there was a tetonic gradient. Previous studies had shown a large variation in channel steepness along the Bolinas Ridge, North of San Fransico along the San Andreas fault. We linked the hillslopes and ridgetops to channel pixels and were able to quantify how curvature and reliev along this landform evolved in concert. We beleive this is the first analysis to fully couple channel steepness, hillslope relief and hillslope curvated.
