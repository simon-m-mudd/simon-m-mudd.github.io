Marsh Edge

{% include toc.html %}

## Research

  In this paper we explored the dynamics of a changing marsh in the Solway Firth, which lies between England and Scotland. We used an algorithm to detect the marsh platform, and then extracted profiles perpendicular to this marsh edge. This was used to explore how marsh edge profiles change after and erosion or aggradation event, and if marsh edge profiles before the event are different from profiles that do not erode.
