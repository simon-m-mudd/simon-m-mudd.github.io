Geochemistry

{% include toc.html %}

## Geochemistry
  
  We have models of geochemical evolution of soil that take into account the path of particles as they are detached from parent material and enter mobile regolith. 
  
  In addition we have models and tools for calculating erosion rates from cosmogenic nuclides.
