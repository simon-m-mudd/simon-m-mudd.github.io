I've been lucky to collaborate with some amazing PhD students and postdocs. I can only hope they learned as much from me as I learned from them.

## Opportunities in the Land Surface Dynamics Group

### Studentships

Our group has a wide range of both PhD and Master by research students. Our students often work collaboratively (see our publication lists: frequently papers have more than one student author) and our vibrant group meets weekly for informal talks, paper discussions, etc. We are open to enquiries about PhD projects. If you are considering doing a PhD with us, please don’t hesitate to contact some of our past or current students.  

#### PhD

The main source of funding for our PhD students is through the E4 Doctoral Training Partnership: [E4DTP](https://www.ed.ac.uk/e4-dtp) 

E4 studentships are open to any nationality, but there are a limited number of places for studnets who are not resident in the UK. Please see the following website for details: [Applications for non UK residents](https://www.ed.ac.uk/e4-dtp/how-to-apply/entry-and-eligibility-criteria)

There are several other sources of potential PhD funding, and information about these can be found here: [Funding sources for PhD](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/postgraduate/phd/fees-funding/funding)

#### Masters by research

We are open to students doing a Masters by research, but we cannot supply funding for this so you will need to secure your own funding. See this link: [Funding for MSc by research](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/postgraduate/phd/fees-funding/funding)

#### Taught Masters

We welcome students in taught Masters who wish to do a thesis on topics in geomorphology. To apply for taught masters, see this website: [Taught master's at Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/postgraduate/taught-masters)

### Post-doctoral and Staff opportunities

If you have a PhD and want a research position with us, there are three options:
* Competitive fellowships
* Post-docs linked to funding we have received
* Funding from your country

#### Fellowships

We welcome enquiries about fellowships. One thing to note is that all of these fellowships are very competitive. You will need both a strong proposal and an excellent publication record. The most common fellowships are (please see links for deadlines)
* NERC fellowships. Most potential fellows apply to the Independent Research fellowships but note that other schemes have higher success rates. See the NERC website: [NERC Fellowships](https://nerc.ukri.org/funding/available/fellowships/)
* Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowships. Again, these are both prestigious and very competitive. See information here: [M S-C fellowships](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/node_en) 
* Leverhulme fellowships:  [Leverhulme fellowship information](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships)
* Newton International fellowships: [Newton fellowship information](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/newton-international/)
* Royal Society of Edinburgh Fellowships: [RSE fellowship information](https://www.rse.org.uk/awards/rse-personal-research-fellowships/)
* If you are from the United States, the NSF considers post-doctoral fellowships that are based abroad. See this website for information: [NSF fellowship information](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503144&org=NSF)

#### Post-docs linked to Land Surface Dynamics funded projects

We occasionally have funding for post-doctoral researchers. The best way to see if any are available is to follow our twitter account: [Edinburgh landsurf twitter](https://twitter.com/EdinLandSurf)

#### Funding from your country

There are many opportunities for funding from other countries (China, in particular, has many funding opportunities): if your native country has researcher funding we are happy to discuss letters of support and co-developed projects. 

### Visiting Students

We frequently host visiting students, researchers and staff. See this website for information: [visiting student information](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/postgraduate/phd/visiting-students). Please get in touch about the organising a visit. Note that we do not have funding for visitors.

#### Collaborations

We welcome collaborative proposals. Come and see us at conferences or drop us an e-mail!
